Enabling users to:

- Stake/Unstake to get yield with an RToken
- Govern and manage RTokens

## Getting started

Clone this repository and run:

npm i
npm start
```

## Adding an RToken to the supported list

Please go to [this repository](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/rtokens) and create a pull request with the token you want to add following the instructions of the README.

## Run end-to-end test

You need to install [Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/anvil/README.md).

Setup `playwright` headless browsers using the following command:

```
yarn playwright install --with-deps
```

Then run the test:

```
# Generate the RToken data (collaterals, balance slot & allowance slot)
yarn tsx tests/getRTokens.ts > tests/RTokens.json
# Run e2e for AAVE Wrapper
yarn playwright test tests/AAVEWrapper.gui.ts --trace on
# Run e2e for Convex Staking Wrapper
yarn playwright test tests/ConvexStakingWrapper.gui.ts --trace on
# Run the test for all RToken
yarn playwright test tests/RToken.gui.ts --trace on
```

Use the following command to view the test trace:

```
yarn playwright show-trace test-results/RToken.gui.ts-Mint-RToken-0xE72B141DF173b999AE7c1aDcbF60Cc9833Ce56a8-chromium/trace.zip
