            - the user interface for registering, inspecting, and interacting
            with Decentralized Token Folios (”DTFs”). A DTF is the generic name
            given to asset-backed indexes. DTFs can be permissionlessly created
            on the Reserve Protocol.

            Whether you're an economist looking to improve the fiat standard, a
            DeFi-entrepreneur seeking to fill a gap in the market, or simply an
            innovator with a wild idea, anyone can create their own asset-backed
            index.

            DTFs live on a blockchain, either Ethereum, Base, or Solana which
            means that they can be transacted worldwide within seconds. They're
            also 100% backed by other assets living on that same blockchain. The
            users of the currency can - at any time - redeem their DTF for
            backing assets worth the same value.
