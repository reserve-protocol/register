      <h2>1. Welcome to Reserve.org and app.reserve.org!</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of
        both Reserve.org and app.reserve.org (the “Services”). The Services are
        brought to you by ABC Labs, LLC (“ABC Labs,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). To
        use the Services, you must legally be able to enter into this agreement.
        By using or otherwise accessing the Services, you (1) agree that you
        have read and understand these Terms and (2) accept and agree to these
        Terms. If you do not agree to the Terms, then your only recourse is not
        to use the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use the Services, you must be of the age of majority in the
        jurisdiction in which you reside and legally be able to enter into this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reserve.org and app.reserve.org provide information about and resources
        to interact with the decentralized application known as the Reserve
        Protocol, which is comprised of open-source smart contracts that are
        deployed on various permissionless public blockchains, such as Ethereum
        (the “Reserve Protocol”). The Reserve Protocol allows for the
        permissionless creation of tokens which are issuable and redeemable by
        anyone for a defined set of other tokens (called “DTFs”). Because the
        Reserve Protocol is open source software that runs autonomously on a
        blockchain network, ABC Labs neither controls nor operates any version
        of the Reserve Protocol on any blockchain network, so you use it at your
        own risk. Collateral assets which back DTFs are held by Reserve Protocol
        smart contracts and are not accessible to ABC Labs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reserve Rights (“RSR”) is a governance token used in the Reserve
        Protocol that permits, among other things, users to participate in
        governance and provide overcollateralization on yield DTFs. ABC Labs has
        not created, does not control, and takes no responsibility for any DTF
        that has been created on the Reserve Protocol, as all DTFs have been
        permissionlessly created by third parties unaffiliated with ABC Labs.
        ABC Labs does not endorse or recommend any DTF, and you agree that your
        use and interaction with any DTF is at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        RSR holders may stake their RSR to govern specific DTFs. In return for
        providing first-loss capital in the event of a collateral default to
        yield DTFs, RSR stakers can receive some of the revenue generated by the
        collateral of that DTF. RSR stakers may participate in governance by
        independently interacting with the relevant smart contracts. Note
        however, that while the voting contracts and app.reserve.org are
        intended to serve as a convenient way to participate in governance, both
        are experimental and the use of either of them involves a high degree of
        risk. There are numerous ways the voting contracts, the Reserve Protocol
        and app.reserve.org could fail in an unexpected way, resulting in the
        total and absolute loss of all your funds. That being said, although the
        voting contracts and Reserve Protocol have been audited extensively,
        there is no guarantee that this code or future code will be audited in
        the future. ABC Labs is under no obligation and makes no promises to
        audit any code.

      <h3>Modification of Terms</h3>
      <p>
        We may change or update the Services and any part of the Terms at any
        time, for any reason, at our sole discretion. Once any part of the Terms
        is updated and in effect, you will be bound by the Terms if you continue
        to use the Services. We may, at any time, and without liability to you,
        modify or discontinue all or part of the Services.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Services</h2>
      <p>
        Reserve.org and app.reserve.org are informational resources about the
        Reserve Protocol; however, they are not the exclusive or sole resources.
        All information provided in connection with your access and use of the
        Services is intended for informational purposes only. While we strive to
        provide accurate and reliable information, we cannot guarantee the
        accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information provided. It is
        possible that the information may be outdated or subject to errors or
        omissions. It is also possible that Reserve.org, app.reserve.org, and/or
        the Reserve Protocol could fail in an unexpected way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither we nor any affiliated entity is a party to any transaction on
        the blockchain networks underlying the Reserve Protocol. We do not have
        possession, custody or control over any user's digital assets or funds.
        You understand that when you interact with Reserve Protocol, you always
        retain control over your digital assets. Due to the non-custodial and
        decentralized nature of the technology, we are not intermediaries,
        agents, advisors, or custodians, and we do not have a fiduciary
        relationship or obligation to you regarding any other decisions or
        activities that you make when using our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        To interact with the Reserve Protocol using app.reserve.org, you will
        need to connect your self-custodial wallet. Your self-custodial wallet
        is provided by a third party and is governed by separate terms and
        conditions set by the wallet provider. Reviewing and comprehending the
        terms and conditions associated with your chosen self-custodial wallet
        provider is your sole responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transactions using blockchains may require the payment of gas fees,
        which are essentially network transaction fees paid on every transaction
        that occurs on the selected blockchain network. Please note that gas
        fees are non-refundable. We do not provide any services to users or
        deliver, hold, and/or receive payment for digital assets. We do not
        receive any fees for any transactions or the Services.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Assumption of Risk</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          You assume the risks of engaging in novel and experimental technology.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Technologies such as smart contracts, cryptographic tokens, and other
        nascent software, applications, and systems that interact with
        blockchain-based networks are experimental, speculative, inherently
        risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions,
        cyberattacks, or changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks)
        could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of
        digital assets. We assume no liability or responsibility for any such
        risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should not
        access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You acknowledge the risks of using the Services.</strong>
      </p>

        Agreement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes Through Good Faith Negotiations
      </h3>
      <p>
        Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind,
        including an arbitration as set forth below, you and we agree that we
        will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us
        arising out of or relating to the agreement or the Services (each, a
        "Dispute" and, collectively, "Disputes") by engaging in good faith
        negotiations. Such good faith negotiations require, at a minimum, that
        the aggrieved party provide a written notice to the other party
        specifying the nature and details of the Dispute. The party receiving
        such notice shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the notice. Within
        sixty (60) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the
        parties shall meet and confer in good faith by videoconference, or by
        telephone, to try to resolve the Dispute. If the parties are unable to
        resolve the Dispute within ninety (90) days after the aggrieved party
        sent the initial notice, the parties may agree to mediate their Dispute,
        or either party may submit the Dispute to arbitration as set forth
        below.
      </p>

      <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
      <p>
        You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the
        procedures set forth above will be settled by arbitration in Reno,
        Nevada, to be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined
        Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The determination of the arbitrator in
        such proceeding shall be final, binding and non-appealable, and judgment
        upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
        having jurisdiction thereof. The language of the arbitration shall be
        English. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the
        terms of the "Limitation of Liability" subsection of these Terms as to
        the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
        The prevailing party will be entitled to an award of their reasonable
        attorney's fees and costs. Except as may be required by law, neither a
        party nor its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or
        results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent
        of (all/both) parties.

        PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND,

        DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER WEBSITE,
        APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSION, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL

        This Agreement is effective unless and until terminated by either you or
        us. You may terminate your agreement with us at any time by ceasing all
        access to the Services. If, in our sole judgment, you fail, or we
        suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of

        deny you access to the Services. We further reserve the right to

        Services exposes us to risk or liability; (b) you are using the Services
        for unlawful purposes; or (c) it is not commercially viable to continue
        providing you with our Services. All of these are in addition to any
        other rights and remedies that may be available to us, whether in equity
        or at law, all of which we expressly reserve.

      <h2>13. Severability</h2>
      <p>
        In the event any provision of these Terms is held invalid or
        unenforceable, such holding shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
        any other provision hereof.

      <h2>14. Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms may be assigned without your prior consent to any ABC Labs
