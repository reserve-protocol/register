            Welcome to Register - the user interface for registering,
            inspecting, and interacting with RTokens. "RToken" is the generic
            name given to asset-backed stablecoins created on the Reserve
            Protocol, the creation of which is entirely permissionless.

            Whether you're an economist looking to improve the fiat standard, a
            DeFi-entrepreneur seeking to fill a gap in the market, or simply an
            innovator with a wild idea, anyone can create their own asset-backed
            currency.

            RTokens live on a blockchain, either Ethereum or Base, wich means
            that they can be transacted worldwide within seconds. They're also
            100% backed by other assets living on that same blockchain. The
            users of the currency can - at any time - redeem their RTokens for
            backing assets worthe the same value.

            Whenever you see the term "overcollateralization", we're referring
            to the built-in defence mechanism included in RTokens that help
            protect their stability in the case of any of their backing assets
            defaulting.

          Register is an open source project developed and maintained by The
          Reserve Protocol as the first dApp to interact with the Reserve
          Protocol and RTokens deployed with the platform.

          If an RToken is listed on Register, it doesn't mean that Reserve
          Protocol endorses the safety or risk levels of the RToken. The Reserve
          Protocol requires Github requests with additional information beyond
          what is available on the blockchain to give users relevant data to
          make informed decisions. As a user, please evaluate any new RToken
          carefully before holding or staking your RSR on them.
